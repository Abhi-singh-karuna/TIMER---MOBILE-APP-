## 2. ⚡ Live Focus Mode (Landscape View)
The heart of the app. This is the "Timeline" view when you rotate your phone sideways.

*   **The Timeline:**
    *   Think of it like a calendar or a video editor timeline.
    *   Time flows from left to right (e.g., 8:00 AM -> 9:00 AM -> 10:00 AM).
*   **The "NOW" Line:**
    *   A glowing **Cyan Laser Line** that cuts vertically through the screen.
    *   It stays in the specific center or moves with time to show *exactly* where you are in your day.
*   **"Swimlanes":**
    *   Horizontal rows for different tasks (like lanes in a swimming pool).
    *   Allows you to see overlapping tasks or parallel activities.
*   **Glass Task Blocks:**
    *   Your tasks appear as glass rectangles on the timeline.
    *   **Drag & Drop:** You can tap and drag a block to reschedule it.
    *   **Pinch to Resize:** You can make a task longer or shorter by pinching it (just like zooming into a photo).
*   **The Dock (Bottom Bar):**
    *   **Play Button:** Starts the timer for the selected task.
    *   **Quick Stats:** Small icons showing your current streak or total focus time.

## 3. ⏳ Focus Timer (Active Mode)
When you hit "Play" on a task, you enter this immersive mode.

*   **Full-Screen Timer:**
    *   Distraction-free interface.
    *   Giant numbers (e.g., "45:00") showing time remaining.
    *   **Background:** Deep dark mode with a subtle pulse effect.
*   **Progress Bar:**
    *   A massive, screen-filling bar that slowly fills up as time passes.
    *   Gives you a peripheral sense of time without needing to read numbers.
*   **Slide to Complete:**
    *   Instead of a boring "Stop" button, you **slide a glowing handle** across the bottom to finish the session. It feels satisfying, like unlocking a phone.
*   **Audio Focus:**
    *   Plays optional white noise or focus sounds (Rain, Cafe, etc.) during the timer.

## 4. ⚙️ Settings & Customization
Where you make the app yours.

### A. 🎨 Theme & Appearance
*   **Color Themes:** Choose from presets like "Dark Knight" (Stealth), "Neon Cyan" (Cyberpunk), or "Golden" (Luxury).
*   **Glass Intensity:** Adjust how transparent or blurry the glass panels look.

### B. 📅 Schedule & Logic
*   **"Logical Day" Start:**
    *   For night owls. You can accept that your "Day" starts at 4 AM instead of midnight.
    *   This keeps your late-night work (e.g., 2 AM) on the "Current Day" instead of switching to "Tomorrow".
*   **Leave Management:**
    *   Mark specific dates as "Leave" or "Holiday".
    *   The app won't schedule recurring tasks on these days.

### C. 🔁 Recurring Tasks (Smart Repeat)
*   **Flexible Rules:**
    *   "Every Weekday" (Mon-Fri).
    *   "Every 3 Days".
    *   "Last Friday of the Month".
*   **Streak Tracking:**
    *   Ideally keeps count of how many times in a row you've done a recurring habit.
    *   Shows a "Fire" icon 🔥 for high streaks.

### D. 🔔 Notifications & Sounds
*   **Completion Sounds:** Choose a satisfying "Ding", "Chime", or "Success" sound when a timer finishes.
*   **Reminders:** Get nudged before a task starts.

## 5. 📊 Analytics (Stats)
*   **Focus Distribution:** A pie chart showing where your time went (e.g., 40% Work, 30% Study, 30% Break).
*   **App Usage:** Total hours focused this week vs. last week.
