# 🏷️ App Name Suggestions (SEO Optimized)

The previous suggestions were good ("Horizon", "Tempo"), but they are common words, meaning you'd compete with thousands of other sites for Google ranking.

To win at SEO (Search Engine Optimization), you need a **"Brandable Keyword"**—a word that doesn't exist yet or is a unique combination.

Here are 5 unique names designed to be **owned by you** on the internet.

### 1. 🏆 Chronoscape
*   **Formula:** *Chronos* (Time) + *Landscape* (Your key feature).
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **SEO:** "Chronoscape" is a very rare word. You could easily rank #1 for this.
    *   **Meaning:** It perfectly describes your app: "Visualizing time across a wide view."
    *   **Vibe:** Sounds scientific, premium, and expansive.

### 2. 🌅 Horizone (or HoriZone)
*   **Formula:** *Horizon* + *Zone* (Flow State).
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Wordplay:** "Get in the *HoriZone*." It connects your landscape view (horizon) with the productivity goal (getting in the zone).
    *   **SEO:** Distinct spelling of "Horizon" makes it easier to find.
    *   **Vibe:** Calm, steady, focused.

### 3. 🔭 FocusVista
*   **Formula:** *Focus* + *Vista* (A pleasing wide view).
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Visuals:** "Vista" implies a beautiful, wide panoramic view—exactly what your landscape mode provides.
    *   **Clarity:** Even if someone hears the name, they know it's about seeing your focus clearly.
    *   **SEO:** "Focus Vista" is likely a very low-competition keyword compared to just "Focus".

### 4. 🌈 SpectraTime
*   **Formula:** *Spectra* (Spectrum of colors/light) + *Time*.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Aesthetic:** Highlights your app's neon, colorful, dark-mode design.
    *   **Tech:** Sounds precise and high-tech (like "Spectral analysis").

### 5. ⏳ TimePanora
*   **Formula:** *Time* + *Panorama*.
*   **Why it works:**
    *   **Literal:** It describes the sliding, panoramic timeline of your app.
    *   **Uniqueness:** Very unique. No one else is using this.
